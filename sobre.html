        <p class="apresentacao">Here, I'm going to talk about myself, my interests and my aspirations.</p>

    <p class="sobremim">I'm 19 years old! Still a young man learning his way.<br>
    I like mathematics, physics and science-related content.<br>
    I'm also into sports, such as basketball and football (it's not called soccer if you only use your feet!)<br>
    I love to learn new things and improve myself, and I despise not progressing in life.<br>
    Ich spreche ein bisschen Deutsch! Ich liebe es, Deutsch zu lernen!<br>     
    I was born and raised in Indaiatuba, SÃ£o Paulo.<br>
    I live with my parents, and my 2 cats.<br>
    I love music, both listening and playing (electric and acoustic guitar).<br> 
    </p>

    <p class="aspiracoes">I aspire to be better everyday, in every way.<br>
    I'm always trying to learn and get better at everything I do!<br>
    There is no better feeling than being good at what you do!<br>
    I'm searching for a job position for Jr Developer, Jr Analyst etc.<br>
    I want to practice what I learned at college, and dive deeper in the developing career!
